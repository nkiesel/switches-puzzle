# Switches Challenge

You wind up in a very long, narrow, and circular hallway. The hallway has switches on the wall, but no other features
that allow you to identify where you are in the hallway. These switches are all at the same height, and all have the
same distance of 1 step to their left and right neighbor switch. The switches can be toggled by you, and when you
start, they are in a random position which is either up or down. You can see if a switch is up or down, and toggle it,
but you are not allowed to mark them or their location (e.g. you cannot drop a shoe in the hallway or rip a switch out
of the wall). You are alone in the hallway. If you toggle a switch, it will stay in that position until you toggle it
again.

Now here is the problem: you can only leave the hallway after you figured out how many switches are in the hallway. How
do you do that?
